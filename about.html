<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p><h5>We explored this topic to understand how designers with and without experience are productive.
    In general we explored how they define productivity while still being creative. Through the contextual 
    inquiries we understood how they approached work. Through the detailed interviews we understood what 
    is their priorities, motivations, routines, etc. We collected various artifacts and evidence which 
    supported their conversations.</h5></p>
<h3>Research Information</h3>
<p><h5>We conducted 2 contextual inquiries with a junior and senior designer. We then conducted 7 interviews 
    with designers with 10+ and with 1+ years of experience. We also conducted a survey with less experienced 
    designers.</h5></p>
